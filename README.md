## Overview
This project develops a **Recommendation System** to provide personalized suggestions based on user behavior and preferences.  
It follows the **CRISP-DM** methodology and explores recommendation approaches.

The project aims to:
â€¢ Find abnormal users of e-shop. 
â€¢ Generate features 
â€¢ Build a model 
â€¢ Create a metric that helps to evaluate quality of the model

## ðŸ“‹ CRISP-DM Methodology
1. **Business Understanding** â€“ Define objectives & business questions
2. **Data Understanding** â€“ Explore and profile the dataset
3. **Data Preparation** â€“ Clean & prepare data for modeling
4. **Modeling** â€“ Build recommendation algorithms
5. **Evaluation** â€“ Assess performance with metrics like RMSE, Precision@K
6. **Deployment** â€“ Present results & optional interactive demo

## Analytical Questions
1.	Which products/content are most frequently interacted with by users?
2.	Which user segments have similar purchase/viewing behaviors?
3.	What products/content have high engagement but low recommendation exposure?
4.	How do seasonal trends affect product/content interactions?
5.	Can we predict a user's next likely purchase or content choice?
6.	Which users are most likely to churn (stop engaging)?
7.	Can we recommend diverse products to expand user interests?
